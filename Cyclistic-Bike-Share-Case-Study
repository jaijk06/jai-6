# Case Study: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
**From Casual Riders to Annual Members**

## 1. Project Overview
This case study is part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. As a junior data analyst on the marketing team, 
my goal is to analyze historical trip data to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
These insights will help design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members, ensuring the company’s long-term growth.

## 2. Ask
**Business Task:** Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members by identifying trends in their bike usage.

**Stakeholders:**
* **Lily Moreno:** Director of Marketing.
* **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** Responsible for data collection and analysis.
* **Cyclistic Executive Team:** Decision-makers for the marketing program.

## 3. Prepare
The data used for this analysis is Cyclistic’s historical trip data. 
* **Data Source:** Public data provided by Motivate International Inc.
* **Organization:** Monthly CSV files containing trip IDs, bike types, start/end times, and station information.
* **Licensing:** Data made available under a specific public license.

---

## 4. Process
I used **SQL** and **Excel** to clean and transform the data.
* **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates and rows with missing station names.
* **New Columns:** Created `ride_length` (calculating the duration of each trip) and `day_of_week`.
* **Verification:** Checked for outliers, such as rides with negative durations or durations longer than 24 hours.

## 5. Analyze
Key trends identified during the analysis:
* **Usage Frequency:** Annual members take more frequent, shorter trips, likely for commuting.
* **Weekend Peaks:** Data visualization reveals that casual riders average trip duration peaks on saturdays and sundays(reaching over 30 minutes)
    and during summer months.
* **Ride Duration:** On average, casual riders spend more time per trip compared to members.

## 6. Share

My analysis revealed that casual riders primarily use Cyclistic for leisure, while members use it as a reliable daily transport method.

## 7. Act
Based on the data, here are my top three recommendations:
1.  **Seasonal Promotions:** Launch summer-specific digital marketing campaigns targeting casual riders.
2.  **Weekend Membership Plans:** Offer a "Weekend-Only" or "Leisure" membership to bridge the gap for casual riders.
3.  **Email Marketing:** Use the ride duration data to show casual riders how much they would save annually with a membership.
